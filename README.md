Devcontainers are a feature of Visual Studio Code that allow you to define a development environment in a container. This allows you to have a consistent development environment across different machines and operating systems. This is adapted also to different other edtitors like PhpStorm.

## Example file for plugin development

```json
{
	"image": "ghcr.io/shopwarelabs/devcontainer/symfony-flex:6.6.3-8.3",
	"workspaceMount": "source=${localWorkspaceFolder}/,target=/var/www/html/custom/plugins/FroshTools,type=bind",
	"workspaceFolder": "/var/www/html",
